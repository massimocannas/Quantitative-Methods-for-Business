Small travel startups that run weekend trips from a hub city (e.g., Barcelona) must book vehicles and staff before final passenger numbers are known. Booking too-large vehicles wastes money; booking too-small vehicles loses customers or forces expensive last-minute alternatives. 

This project uses Linear Programming (LP) to choose vehicle combinations that minimise cost per served passenger and Decision Analysis (decision trees with expected values) to decide whether to confirm, wait, or cancel trips under demand uncertainty. The approach yields practical decision rules that reduce expected losses and improve resource allocation.
