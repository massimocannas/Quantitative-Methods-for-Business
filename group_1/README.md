Brief presentation of Group Essay: The project applies linear programming techniques to formalize and solve an academic planning optimization problem. The model represents the decision process of two university students who must complete their degree requirements under distinct credit and time constraints.The first student is required to obtain 9 ECTS credits and graduate in the February session, while the second student must obtain 12 ECTS credits and graduate in the July session. The decision variables represent the selection of available exams to be taken by each student.Each exam is associated with three quantitative parameters: probability of passing, required preparation time, and expected grade. All exams are worth 6 credits, while seminars, worth 3 credits, are included as auxiliary options; seminars are excluded from the objective function since they are ungraded and do not depend on the decision variables. The optimization problem is subject to credit completion constraints and graduation deadline constraints, and aims to determine the optimal combination of exams (and seminars, if needed) that maximizes academic performance while minimizing preparation effort and risk of failure.
