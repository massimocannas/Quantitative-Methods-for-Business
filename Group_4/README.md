<br>Our topic:  Choosing the Best Study Method for QM test


Context: Student Life

Problems:
<br>We need to learn for the QM test but, 
<br>  -we only have 1 day (24hours) to study
<br>  -we have longer time (1 week) to study.
<br> So we need to choose the best study method, each with different time commitments and uncertain outcomes regarding my final grade. This uncertainty makes me anxious and sometimes leads to poor preparation choices.

Goal: To identify one real context I personally know.
 Study methods:
1. Active Recall
2. Spaced Repetition
3. The Feynman Technique
4. AI
