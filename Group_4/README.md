<br>Our topic:  Choosing the Best Study Method for QM test


Context: Student Life

We are students at the university and we need to make a decision about whether we should start studying for the next QM test 1 week or 1 day before the test happens. For studying we can choose from different techniques:

•	Active recall: is a learning principle that requires you to intentionally challenge your brain to retrieve information from memory rather than passively reviewing it. By forcing yourself to answer a question or summarize a concept without looking at your notes, you strengthen neural pathways and significantly improve long-term retention. 

•	Feynman technique: is a four-step mental model designed to help you learn a concept deeply by explaining it in the simplest possible terms
(Choose a concept; Teach it to a child; Identify gaps; Review and simplify)

•	AI: Summarizing the studied topic, learning through podcasts, videos, graphs, etc. made by the artificial intelligence

If we choose the 1 week learning option and chose to use Feynman technique and after 4 days we realized that we could finish all the topics with Feynman so we switched to a faster learning technique which is AI. We also added a chance for mental breakdown which refers to the state where an individual (student) cannot bear the pressure and tension of studying so he/she has a melt-down which prevent her/him from further studying hereby he/she fails.

For each outcome we have different probabilities which we calculated using different studies which shows the effectiveness of the different study methods and the improvement of an individual after using these methods.
