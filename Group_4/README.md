The Student Life Dilemma: Choosing the Best Study Method
Step 1: Individual Reflection (Context Identification)

Real Context: Student Life.



Specific Setting: Preparing for a major, high-stakes final exam (e.g., Quantitative Methods for International Management).

Problem Noticed: I have noticed a recurring issue with my exam preparation: I often have to decide between multiple study methods, each with different time commitments and uncertain outcomes regarding my final grade. This uncertainty makes me anxious and sometimes leads to poor preparation choices..


Goal: To identify one real context I personally know.

Step 2: Group Sharing (Context Selection)

(The group selects this problem based on personal relevance, feasibility, and potential for quantitative analysis).


The group decided this was an excellent choice because:

It is personally relevant—every student faces this dilemma.

Data could realistically exist (past grades, time invested).

It has strong potential for quantitative analysis using techniques like Decision Analysis.


Step 3: Problem Framing (Quantitative Application)
1. What real-life context are you analysing?

Student life: Deciding on the optimal study strategy for a high-stakes final exam.



2. Who is affected by the problem?

The student (myself), who is the decision-maker and whose final grade/GPA is directly affected.

3. What is the practical problem?


Decision under uncertainty: I have a limited amount of time (e.g., 20 hours) to prepare for the exam and must choose the best way to allocate this time across two primary study strategies:

Strategy A (Deep Dive): Focus all 20 hours on complex, conceptual topics (high risk, high reward).

Strategy B (Broad Coverage): Split 20 hours between conceptual topics and simpler, memory-based content (lower risk, moderate reward).

The uncertainty is the difficulty of the actual exam (it could be Concept-Heavy or Mixed/Balanced).

4. Which data would be needed? 

The Payoffs (the final grade/score) for each combination of Strategy (A or B) and Exam Difficulty (Concept-Heavy or Mixed/Balanced). These could be based on historical performance or be hypothetical but sensible (e.g., a grade out of 100).

The estimated Probabilities of the "States of Nature" (how likely the exam is to be Concept-Heavy vs. Mixed/Balanced).

5. Which quantitative technique(s) from the course could apply?


Decision analysis.

Specifically, using a Decision Tree to model the choice, the uncertain outcomes, and the payoffs.

Calculating the Expected Monetary Value (EMV) for each strategy to determine the optimal choice.

6. What outcome do you expect from your model? 


A ranking of best decisions : The model will calculate the expected final grade for Strategy A and Strategy B, clearly indicating which strategy yields the highest average expected grade, thus providing an optimal decision under uncertainty.
