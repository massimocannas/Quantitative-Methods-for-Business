# Quantitative-Methods-for-Business
Repository for student projects works (a.y. 25-26)
Welcome to the official repository for the course Quantitative Methods for Business.
This repository hosts all student project work for the academic year 2025–2026.
Each student group has its own folder inside this repository.
All groups can read and write anywhere in the repo, but every group must work ONLY inside its assigned folder.


## Repository structure
Each group folder should contain the following files, **always with the same names**:

├─ README.md                 # Main README with instructions (the file you are reading now!)
├─ group1/                   # Group 1 folder
│   ├─ data/                 # a data file (.csv, .Rdata, etc) to 
│   ├─ script.R              # R code for the analysis
│   ├─ slides.pdf            # project slides (with a *uniform* and *simple* background)
