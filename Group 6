Business Case

This project analyses a transportation and logistics decision problem within a manufacturing supply chain. The case considers the daily transportation of raw materials (logs) from multiple logging sites to several sawmills. Each logging site has a limited daily supply capacity, while each sawmill requires a fixed number of truckloads per day to sustain uninterrupted production.

Transportation costs vary across routes due to differences in distance. The analysis is based on real operational data provided for the project,
including distances, supply capacities, demand requirements, and transportation costs.

Objective

The objective of the project is to **minimise total daily transportation cost** while ensuring that:

* all sawmill demand requirements are fully satisfied
* no logging site exceeds its available daily supply
* transportation decisions are operationally feasible

The decision variables represent the number of truckloads shipped from each logging site to each sawmill per day.

Data

The analysis uses real data provided within the project framework, representing a daily transportation planning scenario. The dataset includes:

* daily supply capacities at each logging site
* daily demand requirements at each sawmill
* distances between logging sites and sawmills
* transportation cost per mile and round-trip assumptions

The total available supply equals total demand, resulting in a balanced transportation problem, which is appropriate for linear programming analysis.

Methodology

The problem is formulated as a linear programming optimisation model, specifically a transportation problem, which is a structured special case of linear programming.

The objective function minimises total transportation cost subject to:

* supply constraints at each logging site
* demand constraints at each sawmill
* non-negativity constraints on all decision variables

The optimisation approach follows methods presented in the Quantitative Methods for Business course.
